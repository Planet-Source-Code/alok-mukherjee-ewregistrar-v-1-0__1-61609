### Description

Search and Register / Unregister ActiveX EXE / DLL / OCX / OLB / TLB from within one UI.

This is Update to my first submission of EWRegister V.1.0 to PSC. In this version, Registry Clean-up is taken into consideration. The compiled version is further compressed by UPX, this makes really a difference for spped and size. UPX will typically reduce the file size of programs and DLLs by around 50%-70%. One can download this from http://upx.sourceforge.net.

After frequent reformatting of my system, I had to search OCX,DLL,TLB,OLB and ActiveX EXE files to re-register by copying them individually to Windows System / System32 directory then run Regsvr32.Exe to register. This is really a tedious job for any programmer. So I decided to make this little utility for finding DLL/OCX/TLB/OLB/ActiveX EXE files in a Drive / Directory, then to register / un-register them.

This will create a LOG file in Application directory under \LOG directory if any file is registered / Un-registered ( provided, user presses Report Button ).

Frankly speaking, I have designed the User Interface but most of the codes / controls are taken from PSC only. I am grateful to all of those great programmers who have taught me how to write a program by giving their source codes free in PSC or subsequent sites.

I will be grateful if I get a feedback on my job ( bugs, must be there ) , so that corrections can be made.

Thanks to all of you who have downloaded this, and hope u will Vote for me.
