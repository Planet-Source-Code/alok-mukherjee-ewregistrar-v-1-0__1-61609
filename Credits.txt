This is my first submission to PSC.  After frequent reformatting of my system, I had to search OCX,DLL,TLB,OLB and ActiveX EXE files to re-register by copying them individually to Windows System / System32 directory then run Regsvr32.Exe to register.  This is really a tedious job for any programmer.  So I decided to make this little utility for finding DLL/OCX/TLB/OLB/ActiveX EXE files in a Drive / Directory, then to register / un-register them.

This will create a LOG file in Application directory under \LOG directory if any file is registered / Un-registered ( provided, user presses Report Button ).

Frankly speaking, I have designed the User Interface but most of the codes / controls are taken from PSC only.  I am grateful to all of those great programmers who have taught me how to write a program by giving their source codes free in PSC or subsequent sites.

I will be grateful if I get a feedback on my job ( bugs, must be there ) , so that corrections can be made.

Thanks, and hope u will Vote me.
